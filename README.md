# ElifLego — Brick Studio

A browser-based 3D LEGO builder. Snap real bricks onto a studded baseplate, stack them in
every valid configuration (staggered, overhanging, mixed brick/plate heights), and switch
between visual themes.

No build step — plain ES modules + [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) loaded from a CDN via an
import map. Open it on any static host (GitHub Pages) or a local server.

## Run locally

ES modules need HTTP (not `file://`):

```bash
cd ElifLego
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000
```

## Controls

| Action | Input |
| --- | --- |
| Orbit / pan / zoom | left-drag / right-drag / wheel |
| Slide the piece | move mouse (it stays on the surface, hangs off edges) |
| Nudge 1 stud | arrow keys |
| Rotate 90° | `R` |
| Place | click (green = supported, red = would float) |
| Delete | `ESC` to deselect, then click a piece |

## How snapping works

Space is a voxel grid at **plate** resolution (a brick is 3 plates tall). A piece rests at the
highest level where at least one of its studs is supported, so you can offset a 2x4 on a 2x4
down to a single stud of grip — but never float it with zero support.

## Project layout

Everything is split so adding shapes never means editing a giant file.

```
index.html          shell + import map
css/styles.css
js/
  constants.js      grid units
  colors.js         color palette
  themes.js         aesthetics
  kinds.js          PART REGISTRY — add shapes here
  occupancy.js      voxel grid (collide / support / valid)
  selection.js      current piece / color / rotation
  scene.js          scene, camera, baseplate, theme
  factory.js        builds a mesh group for any kind
  snapping.js       cursor → snapped target
  ghost.js          preview + nudge + footprint marker
  blocks.js         place / delete / occupancy writes
  input.js          pointer + keyboard
  ui.js             sidebar built from the registry
  main.js           wire-up + render loop
```

## Adding a new shape

Add one `registerKind({...})` call in `js/kinds.js` (or a new file that imports `registerKind`):

```js
registerKind({
  id: 'tile', label: 'Tiles', heightPlates: 1, studs: false, colorable: true,
  geometry: boxGeometry, sizes: ['1x2', '2x2', '2x4'],
});
```

It shows up in the palette automatically. For a custom shape, pass your own
`geometry(fw, fd, h)` builder.

## Movable parts

Wheels, propellers, and fans **spin** on their own (a real animation). The **Animation**
toggle in the sidebar pauses them so you can build precisely.

**Mounting on axles:** place an axle (Technic tab), then select a wheel/propeller/fan and move
the cursor near the axle — it snaps onto the nearest **mid or end** point and aligns its spin
axis to the axle. Away from an axle they place freely on the grid.

**Axles on block sides:** an axle can lie on top of a block (grid) *or* snap to a block's
vertical **side face**, sticking out perpendicular — hover a side and it attaches. Press **M**
to toggle whether the axle's **end** or **middle** sits on the face. Great for a windmill arm
poking out of a tower.

## Gears & driveline (mechanics)

The first real mechanics: **one axle can turn another**.

- **Crank** (Mechanics tab) drives the axle it's mounted on. A mounted propeller/fan/wheel also
  drives its axle, so a windmill's blades can power a drivetrain.
- **Gears** mount on axles. Put a gear on each of two **parallel axles spaced by the sum of the
  gears' radii** and they **mesh** — the follower turns the opposite way at the tooth ratio
  (a small gear driving a big one turns it slower, and vice-versa). Rotation propagates through
  a whole chain of meshed gears, and anything on a driven axle (wheels, more gears) turns with it.

Try: two 4x1 axles two studs apart, a crank on one, a 2x2 gear on each where they meet.
Turn Animation on and the second axle spins the other way.

Still simple — no torque/load, no conflict handling if a chain is over-constrained.

## Saving

- Builds **auto-save to `localStorage`** on every place/delete, so they survive a refresh.
- **Named builds:** in the BUILDS panel, *Save As* stores the current build under a name,
  *Load* restores it, *Delete* removes it. Multiple builds are kept.
- **Export / Import** a build as a JSON file for backup or sharing.

## Roadmap

- Particle water (tiny mass-bearing droplets) for the Water piece
- Multi-size / multi-brightness light bricks
- Axle-driven mechanics (gears/constraints) so wheels are actually powered
- More parts (doors, curved slopes, wedge plates) as real LEGO elements
- Shareable build links
